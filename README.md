A book review app for learning React, Koa, Knex, and Docker

I'm indebted to [this tutorial](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/build-and-dockerize-a-full-stack-react-app-with-nodejs-and-nginx/), which formed the basis of the idea for this project.

This is a simple app created for the purpose of learning the following technologies in greater depth, using a full-stack development approach:

- [React](https://react.com)
- [Koa](https://koajs.com/)
- [Knex](https://knexjs.org/)
- [Docker](https://docker.com)

To run the project: 

- Ensure that you have Docker installed so you can run Docker Compose.
- Clone the project.
- In the main project folder, run `docker-compose up` to start the app.
- Navigate in the browser to `https://localhost:3050`.
- Try it out!
